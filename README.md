# rFactor2ModDownloader
Tool that simplifies mod downloading for rFactor Servers  


Tested on Linux (rf2 server via Wine) and Windows.  

Modify the Paths to your Directories.  

The default Paths I've added to both, the linux and windows script, refer to a hierarchy like this:  

- rfactor2-dedicated->The Server itself  
- steamcmd->Steamcmd  
- steamapps->Folder for the download of the mods

Feel free to modify the Scripts to match your needs.



Ideas:  
- Asking for the paths on first launch
- Downloading lists of mods via textfiles that contain ids/urls
